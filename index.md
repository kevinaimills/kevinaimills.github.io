## About Me

I am a researcher who works on the ethics of technology, including the ethics of artificial intelligence. I was most recently a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, appointed in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy and the Schwarzman College of Computing. I am currently studying the mathematics underlying machine learning in preparation for a pivot to a technical career.

The 'ai' in my username stands for 'Alastair Ian', which are my middle names.

## Research Interests (Ethics)

- **Artificial Intelligence:** guardrails, alignment
- **Privacy:** privacy interests, the right to privacy, consent to data collection
- **Misinformation:** censorship of social media, historical roots of contemporary misinformation, freedom of speech
- **Manipulation:** dark patterns

I recently gave a talk on why we should be wary of AI guardrails, as they often limit user freedom in undesirable ways. See it here:
