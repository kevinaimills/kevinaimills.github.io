## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, appointed in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy and the Schwarzman College of Computing. I work in the ethics of technology, including the ethics of artificial intelligence.

The 'ai' in my username stands for 'Alastair Ian', which are my middle names.

## Research Interests (Ethics)

- **Artificial Intelligence:** guardrails, alignment
- **Privacy:** privacy interests, the right to privacy, consent to data collection
- **Misinformation:** censorship of social media, historical roots of contemporary misinformation, freedom of speech
- **Manipulation:** dark patterns

I recently gave a talk on AI guardrails, and why they aren't always good things. See it here:
